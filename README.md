## Multiplayer Arena FPS – Alpha

Stratos is a fast-paced multiplayer arena shooter inspired by games like Quake and Straftat, with a focus on advanced movement mechanics and extensible gameplay systems. The project was built as a gameplay and systems-focused prototype, emphasizing modular design, responsiveness, and multiplayer support.

## Features

### Advanced Player Movement
 * High-speed arena movement inspired by classic FPS design
 * Sliding and vaulting mechanics for fluid traversal
 * Momentum-preserving movement tuned for competitive pacing

### Multiplayer (Co-op)
 * P2P Networked multiplayer gameplay
 * Player movement and combat systems built with multiplayer synchronization in mind

### Modular Weapon System
 * Fully modular weapon architecture
 * Weapon spawners are configurable to spawn any weapon type
 * New weapons can be added without modifying spawner logic
 * Clean separation between weapon behavior, data, and spawning logic

### Arena-Style Combat
 * Fast weapon swaps and pickups
 * Spawn-based weapon acquisition
 * Designed for replayable, skill-driven combat encounters

## Project Status

This project is in hiatus and the current alpha primarily serves as a gameplay systems and multiplayer prototype. Visual polish and content depth were intentionally deprioritized in favor of core mechanics, architecture, and iteration speed.

## Repository Notes

* This repository contains the full game source code
* Assets and systems are organized to support rapid iteration
* Intended for portfolio and technical review purposes
